# SimonSays-Game

1.Device Setup: The Simon game device has four large buttons, each a different color and associated with a unique tone (e.g., red, green, blue, yellow).
2.Starting the Game: The game begins with Simon lighting up one of the buttons and playing its corresponding tone.
3.Repeating the Sequence: The player must press the button that Simon lit up.
4.Increasing Complexity: If the player correctly follows the sequence, Simon will repeat the sequence and add one more step (another button will light up, and its tone will play). The player must then repeat the entire sequence in order.
5.Game Progression: The sequence continues to grow longer and more complex with each successful repetition.
6.End of Game: The game ends when the player fails to reproduce the sequence correctly. The goal is to remember and accurately repeat the longest sequence possible.
